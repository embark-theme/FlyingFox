# Embark firefox

This is a wrapper around the FlyingFox firefox theme that changes the default theme to the embark color palette. Best attempts will be made to keep this up to date with original repo.

See the original projects [wiki](https://github.com/akshat46/FlyingFox/wiki) for installation instructions and further details
